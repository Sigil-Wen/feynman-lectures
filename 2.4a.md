# Exercise 2.4 (a) of Exercises for the Feynman Lectures

*Solution by 0xSigil with help from elius & delta1*

Question:
If the sides $d_1$ and $d_2$ remain fixed in length, but the angle $\alpha$ changes by a small amount $\Delta \alpha$, the opposite side $L$ changes by an amount 

$$\Delta L = \frac{d_1 d_2}{L}\sin\alpha\Delta\alpha $$

Solution:

Looking at the diagram, we can use the Cosine Law

$$L^2 = d_1^2 + d_2^2 - 2d_1d_2\cos(\alpha)$$

Simplify to:

$$L = \sqrt{d_1^2 + d_2^2 - 2d_1d_2\cos(\alpha)}$$

Then we partially differentiate (which elius and detla1 taught me over a discord call) and use the chain rule :D

$$\frac{dL}{d\alpha} =  \frac{2d_1 d_2 \sin \alpha}{2\sqrt{d_1^2 + d_2^2 - 2d_1 d_2 \cos \alpha}} $$

Since  $$L = \sqrt{d_1^2 + d_2^2 - 2d_1d_2\cos(\alpha)}$$


$$\frac{dL}{d\alpha} =  \frac{2d_1 d_2 \sin \alpha}{L} $$

Therefore,

$$dL =  \frac{2d_1 d_2 \sin \alpha d\alpha}{L} $$
